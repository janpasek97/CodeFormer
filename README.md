# CodeFormer

## Abstract
_This work introduces CodeFormer, a Python source code generator pre-trained on a massive GitHub crawl consisting of 230M Python functions. The released model, built on BART architecture, generates Python functions based on descriptions in English. On a CodeSearchNet dataset, the CodeFormer sets a new state of the art with 46.12 BLEU, representing an improvement of 13.86 BLEU. We also release a new parallel corpus for code generation called Stack Overflow Code Generation Dataset (SOCGD), on which our model sets a baseline of 47.68 BLEU. The resulting model is ready to be integrated into a source code suggestion system in an IDE, where it can improve software developers' productivity. During our research, we discovered a better way of training the BART for machine translation. However, the applicability of our approach to other domains must be verified in subsequent work._
